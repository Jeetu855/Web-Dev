Version Control(VC)
A system that keeps track of our files and projects
Allows us to revert files to previous state, revert entire project, compare changes over time, see who last modified something so that we can know what might be causing a problem

Centralized VC and Distributed VC

Centralized Server common Each person has entire data about a  
for all project
Good for backup No need for server to be online all
Small team size time
